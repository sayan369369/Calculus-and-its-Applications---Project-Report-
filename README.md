## üßÆ Summary

This project explores the **core principles and applications of calculus**, a fundamental branch of mathematics dealing with change and accumulation.  
It covers both **differential and integral calculus**, with emphasis on their **historical development**, **core theorems**, and **real-world applications** in science and engineering.

### Key Highlights:
- Fundamentals of limits, derivatives, and integrals  
- Applications of differential and integral calculus  
- Case studies on motion analysis, population modeling, cost optimization, and epidemic spread  
- Theoretical framework written in LaTeX
